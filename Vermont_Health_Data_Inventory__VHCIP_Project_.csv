"America's Health Rankings, United Health Foundation","America's Health Rankings, United Health Foundation","America's Health Rankings, United Health Group / ",,http://www.americashealthrankings.org/VT,,,,"For the past 25 years, America’s Health Rankings® has analyzed a comprehensive set of behaviors, community and environmental conditions, policies, and clinical care data to provide a holistic view of the health of the nation. America’s Health Rankings® is the result of a partnership between United Health Foundation, American Public Health Association, and Partnership for Prevention™.<br />Health is a result of our individual genetic predisposition to disease, behaviors, community and environment, policies, and clinical care. Each of us— individually, as a community, and as a society—strives to optimize these health determinants so that all can have a long, disease-free, and robust life regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, or socioeconomic status. The report looks at the 4 groups of health determinants that can be affected: 1.Behaviors include everyday activities that affect personal health. Behaviors include habits and practices we develop as individuals and families that influence our personal health and the use of health resources. Individuals can modify these behaviors with support of community, policy, and clinical interventions. 2.Community and Environment influences quality of life and life expectancy. Healthy and safe communities include those with clean water and air, affordable and secure housing, sustainable and economically vital neighborhoods, and support structures such as violence-free places to be physically active.[1] 3.Policy influences availability of resources to encourage and maintain health. Policy also influences the extent that public and health programs penetrate the general population. Policies can have a wide reach throughout a state, and they promote healthy living and judicious consumption of health care resources. 4.Clinical care reflects the access, quality, appropriateness, and cost of care we receive at doctors’ offices, clinics, and hospitals. Health determinants are intertwined and must work together to be optimally effective. For example, an initiative that addresses tobacco cessation requires individual effort and community support in the form of policies promoting non-smoking and effective counseling and care at clinics. Similarly, reducing the risk of low birthweight babies requires individual effort, education, access to and availability of prenatal care, and high quality health care services. Addressing obesity requires individual actions complemented by food producers and distributors, restaurants, grocery and convenience stores, exercise facilities, parks, urban and transportation design, building design, educational institutions, community organizations, social groups, health care delivery, and insurance. America’s Health Rankings® combines individual measures of each of these determinants with the resultant health outcomes to produce one comprehensive view of the overall health of each state.

The Vermont Department of Health therefore needs to measure the supply of health care providers, including their distribution by geography and specialty.  These data are used as the basis for policy analysis, shortage area designations, and recruitment and retention activities.<br /><br />The Vermont Department of Health has been collecting information on health care providers since 1992.  Physicians (MD's and DOs), Dentists and Physician Assistants are surveyed every two years at the time of their relicensing.  Surveys have also been conducted of APRN's  in 1998, 2000, and 2002 – more recent surveys of APRN's have been done by UVM but not the Department of Health.<br /><br />The surveys are intended to include all active providers, acting as a census rather than a sample survey.  For that purpose the respondents are compared with lists of licensees (from the board of medical practice or the secretary of state), and follow-up is conducted to reach those who did not respond.  Final response rate is usually above 99%.  Included in the surveys and reports are those practitioners who provide patient care in Vermont.  Excluded are the substantial number of providers, mainly physicians, who maintain Vermont licenses even though they do not practice in Vermont.<br /><br />The data collected includes specialty, practice setting, town(s) of practice and the number of hours per week in clinical practice.

The people who use the centers at different times of the day need to be included if we are going to collect surveys from a truly<br />representative sample of our visitors. Each center has specific groups beyond our regular visitors who should be considered as a part of the visitor mix — people coming out of corrections or treatment, individuals on medication assisted treatment, etc. Please make a conscious effort to include them.<br />Because the Participant Survey is such an important source of data for evaluating how well the recovery centers are doing — as well as a key indicator of the characteristics of the individuals who are coming to the centers — it is crucial that we ensure, to the extent we can,<br />that the surveys are completed accurately and honestly. It is therefore important to select carefully and train one or more staff members or trusted volunteers who will administer the Survey.<br />Please note that all recovery centers are required, as a condition of their state funding, to administer and enter into the VRN database a minimum of eight (8) Participant Surveys per month, (25 per Quarter) for a total of at least one hundred (100) Participant Surveys per year.",,,Survey,,,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,Low,,,,,,,,,,Low,No,,David Healy,,,,
