1. Property tax adjustment claims are generally submitted with homestead declarations when income tax returns are filed.  The adjustment amount is based on household income from the previous year and taxes paid in the prior fiscal year.  The adjustments reported on in this table were applied in fiscal year 2016 (Property tax bills paid between July 2015 to June 2016).  ,,,,,,,,,
"2.  Every household that receives an adjustment to their property taxes gets a reduction based on the education (school) property taxes they paid the prior year.  This adjustment was formerly called the ""prebate.""  ",,,,,,,,,
"3. The circuit breaker adjustment is calculated on the combined education and muncipal property taxes remaining after the first adjustment has been appllied. Only those claimants with Household Income of $47,000 or less are eligible for this adjustment.  This adjustment is often called ""additional adjustment"" and was formerly called ""homeowner rebate.""  Cells of 10 or fewer returns suppressed.  State totals include suppressed data.",,,,,,,,,
4. Circuit Breaker recipient numbers are a subset of the School Property Tax adjustment recipients but renter rebate recipients are an entirely separate group. Only year-long Vermont renters are eligible for the renter rebate.  This rebate is calculated based on household income from the previous year and total rent paid in the previous year.  Cells of 10 or fewer returns suppressed.  State totals include suppressed data.,,,,,,,,,
5. Total numbers are the sum of school property tax and renter rebate recipients. Total amounts are additive (School Property Tax plus Circuit Breaker plus Renter Rebate).,,,,,,,,,
* indicates fewer than 10 returns - data suppressed,,,,,,,,,
